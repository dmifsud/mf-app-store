        "This Challenge introduces basic cryptography concepts using data representation, which impacts the way we secure online communication. It teaches classic cryptographic ciphers like rotation, XOR and mixed-substitution, and explains the techniques used to break these forms of encryption. The challenge also explores how cryptography can be used to hide messages in images and sound!\n\nHear from cyber security experts who share what it's like to work in the cyber security industry, and how the skills and knowledge you learn through these activities can set you up for an exciting career after school.\n\nThis Challenge is a part of the Schools Cyber Security Challenges series, developed by Grok Academy in partnership with ANZ, Australian Government: Australian Signals Directorate, AWS, BT, Commonwealth Bank, Australian Government: Department of Industry, Science and Resources, Fifth Domain, NAB and Westpac.",

There are some challenging and relevant topics, such as climate change models and drug development, and they pose real challenges for today's computers. To solve them, we need not just more computing power, we need to re-think how computers work.\u00a0\n\nIn this course, students journey into the world of the microcosmos. They go deep into atoms and explore the characteristics of electrons. There, they meet magnetism and learn how to put it to use for computing.\n\nAlong the way, students visit the labs at Silicon Quantum Computing (SQC) in Sydney through a virtual tour and perform virtual experiments on some of SQC's equipment from the safety of their own computers. For example, students make components of a quantum computer.",
